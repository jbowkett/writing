2018 retrospective

Following the big mifid scramble of 2016 and 2017, 2018 was the year that data 
governance came sharply into focus for many institutions.  Once mifid projects 
consolidated data sources, many organisations started to take a serious look at 
their data governance.  

On the technology side, our view is that big data and Nosql has become “part of 
the furniture”.  The industry has matured to the point where they have the 
tools and people to run data operations at scale.  The major pitfall here is the
"build it and they will come" attitude to big data.  

What is the use if applications can't access, visualise or generate insight?

Data needs to be turned into insight and this insight needs to be turned into
an edge on the competition. This has meant no digitisation roadmap is complete 
without an AI strategy.

Another way to give yourself an edge on the competition is to bring that 
insight into decision making faster than the competition. Big Data is now 
making way for _fast data_.  This is the natural evolution of the data lake 
to kappa-style architectures instead.  

^^ charles river and State Street buy out

It's no lie to say that we're all data companies now.  Data vendors are 
recognising this also and 2018 saw a slew of new startups selling 
access to cleansed and sanitised alternative datasets, ready for enriching 
business and investment decisions often as inputs to data science models.

Docker is proving itself to be one of the most important technologies 
to emerge in the last 5-10 years.  Containers give an unparalleled level of 
consistency to deployments especially when applied to promotion of 
releases between environments.  Containers go hand-in-hand with cloud and 
microservices, all of whic require monitoring.  The sheer number of things 
the modern developer needs to know is truly mind-bogling.  It is true to say 
that techniques like microservices and platforms like Docker have made things
considerably easier on the micro scale.  However these have to interact with
each other and be deployed on a macro scale, along with service meshes and 
monitoring thus multiplying the number of moving parts and thereby the 
complexity.


Docker + containers continue apace.

Commoditisation of data and AI functions.

Data is king - State street's buy-out of Charles River.

Lowering the barrier to entry to use some of this stuff, but there are now 
many many more moving parts

What next for 2019?



What about other tech trends?

Blockchain : finding its use cases, maybe not in finance as much as we’d all 
hoped and hyped, but it is definitely finding a home in places like IOT and the 
public sector.  Ultimately it will find a home in any place where IT leaders 
need to share data between trusted parties with a mathematical guarantee it has 
not been tampered with once consensus is reached.

Microservices : stateless it's all good, however institutions are struggling 
with distributed applications, i.e. single applications that are separated 
into distributed microservices - remember the first rule of distributed 
systems is always: don't do distributed systems.  The distributed big ball of
mud is now a reality for many application ecosystems, giving way to a slow down
in project velocity and an increase in testing overhead.  Are service meshes the
distributed application servers of tomorrow?

Data : Big data and nosql has become part of the furniture.  While data lakes 
provide a firm basis for any organisation to be part of the AI revolution, the 
trick is turning the data into insight and the insight into an edge over the 
competition.  Furthermore, next generation architectures will 
stream that data and insight into the hands of users to enable business 
decisions to happen faster than batch-based systems.

AI and machine learning : still the buzzwords of the finance world...????

UI : 2019 will be the year of the microfrontend.  This is none-too-dissimilar
to portal and portlet technology of old.  However instead of being implemented
in an application server, it is implemented within single page apps and 
individual lightweight server components instead.

UX : UX is important now more than ever.  As we have seen above, data and 
insight are the keys to modern success.  Without a user experience that 
empowers the user to capitalise on that insight quickly and effectively, the 
edge could so easily be lost.



Cassandra is no longer big news.

What have we seen happen in the tech world?
What have we seen happen in the business/company world?
